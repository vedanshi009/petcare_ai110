# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**

Three core actions that a user should be able to perform include adding multiple pets, remove pets and define recurring tasks for the pets like walking bathing etc.
- Briefly describe your initial UML design.
- What classes did you include, and what responsibilities did you assign to each?
Some objects in this system could be as follows:
Pet:
Attributes: id, name, species, age, health_notes, weight
Methods: age_label(), has_health_notes()
Task:
Attributes: id,name, category, priority, duration, non_negotiable
Methods: is_high_priority(), fits_in(minutes), summary()
DailyPlan:
Attributes: date, scheduled_tasks[],skipped_tasks[]
Methods: skipped_count(), scheduled_count()

**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.
I made some changes based on the AI feedback, some of them include:
1. Added DayConstraints relationship to DailyPlan which was missing earlier so that Scheduler can validate that scheduled tasks fit within available_minutes
2. Typed blocked_windows as list[Tuple[int, int]] instead of generic list as Scheduler needs to know exact structure to check time conflicts and as Generic list type is too vague and error-prone
3. Added two new methods: total_scheduled_minutes() and is_valid(), to prevent scheduler from creating plans that exceed available_minutes and enable early testing & debugging of scheduling logic

Later I made other changes, based on the main classes given in the instructions, so the code in the pawpal_systems.py file was restructured.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

---

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?

## 5. Reflection

**a. What went well**

- What part of this project are you most satisfied with?

**b. What you would improve**

- If you had another iteration, what would you improve or redesign?

**c. Key takeaway**

- What is one important thing you learned about designing systems or working with AI on this project?
